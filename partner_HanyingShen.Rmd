Yes, I am able to do so without error. 
My partner and I had a difficult time when we were trying to use Git push to Git Hub. It always shows ! [rejected]        master -> master (non-fast-forward) error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/jessiehwang/ds202_lab1.git' 

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
